# EXPANDER 0.0.0
## Recursively expand all of macros.

### Current lisp world
Common Lisp has strong true macros.

### Issues
ANSI CL does not have operator for recursively expand all of macros.
Library MACROEXPAND-DAMMIT provides it.
But it is slow, not robust, and complex code.

### Proposal
EXPANDER provede it.
