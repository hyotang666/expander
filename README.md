# EXPANDER 0.0.0
## Recursively expand all of macros.

### Current lisp world
Common Lisp has strong true macros.

### Issues
ANSI CL does not have operator for recursively expand all of macros.
Some library provides such features, but one remains `MACROLET` and `SYMBOL-MACROLET`, one always generates `LOCALLY`.
There is no libraries that I want.

### Proposal
